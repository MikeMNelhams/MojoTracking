# Sperm Tracking University of Bristol
This is a repository for all resources for a University of Bristol project on sperm analysis.

The `scripts` contains all of our up-to-date research for our own proposed algorithms for tracking sperm from basic AI-annotated videos of sperm. 
`Final Result` is the main python file, with its own ReadMe file for documentation. 

For an extended review of the algorithms used, there is a `SpermTrackingPaper.pdf` academic paper preview attached with this repository.

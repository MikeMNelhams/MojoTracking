# Sperm Tracking University of Bristol
This is a repository for all resources for University of Bristol project on sperm analysis.
Partial training data is stored in the `tracking_data` directory. 

The `scripts` contains all of our up-to-date research for our own proposed algorithms for tracking sperm from basic AI-annotated videos of sperm. 
`Final Result` is the main python file, with its own Readme file for documentation.

Mojo are a sperm analysis and treatment organisation: https://www.mojofertility.co/. 

This is a repository for all resources for University of Bristol project with Mojo for sperm analysis. 
Partial training data is stored in the `tracking_data` directory. 

The `scripts` contains all of our up-to-date research for our own proposed algorithms for tracking sperm from basic AI-annotated videos of sperm.
